									<h6> New Video Game Announcement Format!</h6>
									</br>
									<p>The format, rules, and regulations for the 2015 Pokémon Video Game Play! Pokémon Championship Series have been announced!

The battles will be standard Double Battles, and most of the Pokémon in the National Pokédex (including many Legendary Pokémon) are permitted. To check an individual Pokémon’s eligibility, look for a blue pentagon on its summary page, underneath its image. View the updated tournament rules and regulations for complete details of the new format. The new format begins on January 1, 2015, and will be used all the way through the 2015 Pokémon World Championships, to be held in August in Boston, Massachusetts, where more than $500,000 in scholarships, Travel Awards, and other prizes will be on the line!

									<h6> Announcing the 2015 Pokémon World Championships!</h6>
									</br>
									<p>Pokémon TCG and video game competitors, we're announcing big changes for the 2015 Pokémon World Championships. First, we're excited to announce that Boston, Massachusetts, will host the 2015 Pokémon World Championships from August 21–23, 2015! Players will be vying for a share of more than $500,000 in scholarship awards, over four times the amount awarded in 2014. The prize for winning it all is higher, too—each Pokémon Video Game World Champion will win a $10,000 scholarship, and each Pokémon TCG World Champion will win a scholarship equaling $25,000! More players than ever will receive invitations to the upcoming World Championships, and consequently the tournament will now last three full days, starting on Friday, August 21. However, depending on the number of Championship Points earned throughout the year, some players will automatically qualify for Day Two and start playing on Saturday! </p>

									<h6> Errata in Recent Pokémon TCG Expansions</h6>
									</br>
									<p>The attacks of each Fighting-type Pokémon in play (both yours and your opponent’s) do 20 more damage to the opponent’s Active Pokémon if it is a Pokémon-EX (before applying Weakness and Resistance). Changes: This stadium should only impact the Active Pokémon-EX belonging to the opponent of the attacking Pokémon. The attacks of the Pokémon this card is attached to do 20 less damage to each of the opponent’s Pokémon (before applying Weakness and Resistance). (Don’t apply Weakness and Resistance for Benched Pokémon.) Changes: This tool should only impact the Pokémon belonging to the opponent of the attacking Pokémon.</p>
